          <h3 class="case-heading">KYC (Know Your Customer) Solution based on Ethereum and Hardware signing</h3>
          <h4 class="case-overview">Overview</h4>
          <p>Trusted Key Solutions, a US based security startup, commissioned Enuma to design an end-to-end digital identity
            solution that would enable customers to validate and share identity information. Traditionally this would involve
            sending ID documents over insecure channels (e.g. email) and expensive KYC and compliance processes. The client
            had a very tight timeframe for development.</p>
          <h4 class="case-solution">Solution</h4>
          <p>Within a few months Enuma developed an end-to-end solution supporting KYC providers, issuers, 3rd party application
            developers, and end-users. Our team started by designing a backend for issuers allowing them to validate individual
            information and generate digital certificates. The backend relied on an HSM (Hardware Security Module) for digital
            signing of certificates. Our team then integrated the solution with different KYC providers enabling document
            recognition, and basic validation. The final solution supported a variety of IDs from over 190 countries. Finally
            Enuma built end user portals that focused on digital identity wallet for iOS and Android devices. The wallets
            leveraged mobile phone secure element processors to sign all transactions in hardware ensuring high levels of
            security.

          <h3 class="case-heading">Blockchain International Payments Solution</h3>
          <h4 class="case-overview">Overview</h4>
          <p>A financial services company based in Japan commissioned Enuma to create a service that would tokenize currencies
            and assets such as USD, EUR, silver, gold, etc. and allow their customers to trade and redeem them. The customer
            requested a blockchain solution so transactions would be visible to customers and key partners, yet stored safely
            across a number of nodes distributed geographically.</p>
          <h4 class="case-solution">Solution</h4>
          <p>Enuma developed a solution based around a Ripple blockchain cluster with development of a a backend service to
            interface with Ripple nodes. The backend exposed a set of endpoints to create assets, issue transactions, and
            query account information. The backend also monitored transactions and notified the customer’s system. Along
            with the core system code, Enuma developed a comprehensive set of unit tests to ensure that every part of the
            system behaved as expected, and allowing the client’s engineering team to fully test any changes before putting
            them into production.</p>

          <p>Enuma has worked with many customers to evaluate the security of their products and engineering practices.</p>
          <h4 class="case-solution">Solution</h4>
          <p>Enuma sits down with the clients engineering team to understand their business, architecture, existing code base,
            engineering practices, etc. We then write a detailed threat model including data flow diagrams, list of potential
            threats, and mitigations. Finally we assisted customers in implementing changes to their code and their engineering
            practices to close the gaps.</p>

          <h4 class="case-overview">Overview</h4>
          <p>Our Client, a Hong Kong bank, wanted to create a credit-card sized device capable of signing transactions such
            as payments and smart contracts to be stored on the blockchain.</p>
          <h4 class="case-solution">Solution</h4>
          <p>Our team designed and product the hardware (PCB design, assembly, packaging). It has an e-paper screen, keypad,
            battery and EMV pad for charging. We wrote a custom firmware capable of generating private keys and signing transactions
            for various blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and MultiChain. Finally we wrote a backend to integrate with
            the existing banking system and capable of interfacing with the card and the blockchain nodes.</p>
